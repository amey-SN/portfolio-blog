Modules I am studying during my degree include object-oriented programming , software engineering , software project management, operating systems , database management systems , web programming , computer networks , design and analysis of algorithms and cyber security . 
My natural curiosity for computers is what drove me towards my computer engineering degree . Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by computers and the technical mechanics behind the monitor I am now eager to secure roles that demand use of the skills gained during my studies
