    Hi I am a Web Developer and an computer engineering undergraduate from
    Wardha . 

    I am currently graduating with bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering  at GCOE Jalgaon and actively looking for Internship opportunities  . 


    Modules I am studying during my degree include object-oriented programming , software engineering , software project management, operating systems , database management systems , web programming , computer networks ,  design and analysis of algorithms and cyber security . 


    My natural curiosity for computers is what drove me towards my computer engineering  degree . Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by computers and the technical mechanics behind  the monitor I am now eager to secure roles that demand use of the skills  gained during my studies . 

    I love to connect with new people and build new  relationships, so feel free to send me a message..
