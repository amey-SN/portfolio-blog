Blackblaze is an incredibly cheap cloud storage solution if you have a lot of data and only a single device. This platform offers unlimited cloud storage for one Mac or PC, plus any external hard drives you want to connect to it, for just $6 per month.


Since Backblaze is designed only to back up a single device, it’s not an ideal solution for syncing projects across all of your devices. Backblaze does have a mobile app so you can easily download files from the cloud to your smartphone. However, it won’t enable you to upload files from your smartphone back to the cloud.

Backblaze is equipped with a number of features to make backing up your files as simple as possible. You can automatically back up files anytime they’re changed or set your backups on a schedule. 

You also have the option to limit how much data the software can transfer at any time so that it doesn’t slow down your computer or Internet connection while you work. Old file versions are automatically retained in your account for 30 days, and you can extend your version retention to one year for $2 per month.

If you need to restore your files after a data loss event, you can request that Backblaze mail you a hard drive with your data on it to speed up the recovery process. The Backblaze software also comes with a built-in tracking software so that you can find your computer if it’s ever lost or stolen. Want to know more?

If you have an Amazon Prime subscription, you might be surprised to find out that you have access to unlimited cloud storage for your photos. Amazon Photos is included with Prime at no additional cost and enables you to upload any number of photos, including RAW files, and up to 5GB of video.
If you’re not an Amazon Prime member, you can subscribe for $12.99 per month or $129.99 per year. Alternatively, you can purchase 100 GB of Amazon Photos space for $1.99 per month or 1 TB for $6.99 per month.

Amazon Photos has a number of tools for managing your images in the cloud. You can edit images, organise photos into albums, and even order prints and photo books from Amazon. Amazon Photos syncs images across all your devices, including an Amazon Echo Show or Fire TV.

We especially like how Amazon Photos handles sharing images. You can share individual photos or albums, as well as create shared groups with multiple albums. These collaborative groups are perfect for delivering photos from multiple shoots to clients and receiving comments back.

The one area where Amazon Photos falls short of competitors is in file search. You can search through your photos and videos by name, but there is no way to add searchable tags or descriptions. So, you need to stay on top of your albums and folders if you want to keep your storage space organised.
